# Summary and Analysis of the 2025 Edmonton Integrated Infrastructure Services Report

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the major infrastructure projects being undertaken by the City of Edmonton's Integrated Infrastructure Services department in 2025. The city is currently managing over 200 projects, focusing on accommodating population growth and building a thriving, inclusive, and sustainable future for Edmonton. The summary below is structured around the three core themes of the report: Transforming Edmonton, Building Community Hubs, and Taking Care of What We Have.

## Transforming Edmonton: Major Transportation and Urban Development Projects

The City of Edmonton is undertaking significant projects to enhance connectivity and support future growth, particularly in transportation and urban revitalization. These initiatives are guided by The City Plan and aim to improve mobility and economic development.

| Project Name | Key Scope and Budget | Target Completion |
|---|---|---|
| Valley Line West LRT | 14 km extension from Downtown to Lewis Farms ($2.6 billion) | 2028 |
| Capital Line South (Phase 1) | 4.5 km extension from Century Park to Heritage Valley ($1.3 billion) | 2029 |
| Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion | Conversion of 15 km of roadway to a six-lane, free-flow freeway ($1.1 billion) | 2027 |
| 50 Street Widening and Grade Separation | Construction of an overpass to eliminate rail crossing delays ($181 million) | 2026 |

A notable urban revitalization project is the **O-day'min Park**, which opened in November 2025. This new downtown park, equivalent in size to 4.5 NFL football fields, was transformed from underutilized parking lots into a community space, serving as a catalyst for private investment and downtown revitalization.

## Building Community Hubs: Social Infrastructure for Wellness

To meet the growing need for connection and belonging, the City is investing in new, inclusive recreational facilities designed to serve as community hubs. The **Coronation Park Sports and Recreation Centre** ($153 million) was completed in November 2025 and is set to open in early 2026. This facility features a 250-meter Category A indoor cycling track (velodrome), aiming to host world-class cycling and triathlon events. In the west end, the **Lewis Farms Facility and Park** ($309 million) is under construction, with a target completion of 2028. It will include a 50-meter pool, two ice rinks, a fitness center, and an Edmonton Public Library branch, serving approximately 75,000 area residents.

## Taking Care of What We Have: Rehabilitation and Modernization

A critical component of the city's strategy is the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to ensure public safety, address aging assets, and modernize facilities to current standards.

| Facility | Rehabilitation Scope and Budget | Status/Completion |
|---|---|---|
| William Hawrelak Park | Full replacement of utilities, roads, and facilities ($134 million) | Reopening Winter 2025/2026 |
| Wellington Bridge | Demolition and replacement of the aging structure ($30 million) | Fall 2026 |
| Southbound Low Level Bridge | Rehabilitation to extend service life as an interim solution ($4.7 million) | Winter 2025/Early 2026 |
| Beaver Hills House Park | Renewal to improve safety, accessibility, and add new amenities (e.g., outdoor climbing wall) | End of 2025 |

These projects, alongside the **Neighbourhood Renewal Program** and **Vision Zero** initiatives, demonstrate the City's commitment to building a future-ready Edmonton by balancing new construction with the essential maintenance and modernization of its existing assets.
