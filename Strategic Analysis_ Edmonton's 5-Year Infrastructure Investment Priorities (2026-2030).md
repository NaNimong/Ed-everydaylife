# Strategic Analysis: Edmonton's 5-Year Infrastructure Investment Priorities (2026-2030)

This report provides a detailed analysis of the City of Edmonton's projected infrastructure investment priorities for the next five years, based on the data and strategic direction outlined in the 2025 Integrated Infrastructure Services Report. The analysis identifies four key investment pillars that will guide the city's transition toward a sustainable, connected, and inclusive metropolitan area, preparing for a projected population of two million.

## 1. Investment Priority Framework

Edmonton's future investment strategy is shifting from mere expansion to **strategic integration** and **modernization**. The following table summarizes the four core investment pillars derived from the 2025 report's project portfolio:

| Priority Pillar | Core Focus | Strategic Goal | Key Project Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Mass Transit & Connectivity** | Accelerating LRT and major road network completion | Enhance urban mobility and reduce carbon footprint | Valley Line West LRT, Capital Line South LRT |
| **Pillar 2: Climate Resilience & LID** | Integrating Low Impact Development (LID) and flood mitigation | Ensure long-term environmental and structural sustainability | LID integration in all new projects, Blatchford Fire Station #8 |
| **Pillar 3: Strategic Asset Renewal** | Modernizing aging infrastructure with added functionality | Maximize asset lifespan and improve public safety/accessibility | William Hawrelak Park Rehabilitation, Bridge Replacements |
| **Pillar 4: Community & Social Infrastructure** | Building integrated community hubs and supportive housing | Support social equity, public health, and community cohesion | Lewis Farms Facility and Park, Holyrood Supportive Housing |

## 2. Pillar 1: Mass Transit and Connectivity

The largest capital commitments are concentrated in transportation, reflecting a clear strategy to transition Edmonton into a transit-oriented city. The next five years will be critical for completing the major LRT extensions and freeway conversions initiated in the 2025 report.

| Project | Budget (Billion CAD) | Target Completion | Strategic Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Valley Line West LRT | $2.6 | 2028 | Connects downtown to Lewis Farms, enabling TOD. |
| Capital Line South LRT (Phase 1) | $1.3 | 2029 | Serves the rapidly growing south and southwest areas. |
| Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion | $1.1 | 2027 | Eliminates traffic signals, improving commercial and commuter flow. |
| 50 Street Widening & Grade Separation | $0.181 | 2026 | Eliminates rail crossing delays, boosting logistics efficiency. |

### Major Project Budget Allocation

## 3. Pillar 2 & 3: Climate Resilience and Strategic Asset Renewal

Investment is increasingly focused on making all infrastructure climate-resilient and maximizing the value of existing assets. The strategy involves not just fixing, but fundamentally upgrading facilities to meet modern standards for accessibility and sustainability.

### Strategic Asset Renewal Projects

| Project | Budget (Million CAD) | Scope of Modernization | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| William Hawrelak Park Rehabilitation | $134 | Full utility replacement, enhanced accessibility, heritage preservation. | Reopening Winter 2025/2026 |
| Wellington Bridge Replacement | $30 | Demolition and replacement to meet modern safety and active transportation standards. | Fall 2026 |
| Low Impact Development (LID) | Integrated | Mandatory application of bioretention gardens and absorbent landscaping in new projects. | Ongoing |

The rehabilitation of William Hawrelak Park exemplifies this strategic approach, transforming a 1967-era facility into a modern, accessible public space.

## 4. Pillar 4: Community and Social Infrastructure

To ensure inclusive growth, significant investment is directed toward social infrastructure that supports public health and social equity.

> "Supportive housing is critical infrastructure that will help prevent and end homelessness in Edmonton." - *2025 Infrastructure Report*

Projects like the **Holyrood Supportive Housing** ($28.4 million) and the **Lewis Farms Facility and Park** ($309 million) are central to this pillar. The Lewis Farms facility, in particular, will serve as a multi-purpose hub, integrating a 50-meter pool, ice rinks, and a public library branch for the west end's growing population.

## 5. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations

The next five years represent a pivotal phase where Edmonton's large-scale capital projects will transition from construction to operation. The investment priorities clearly align with The City Plan's vision for a thriving, inclusive, and sustainable city.

**Key Recommendations for 2026-2030:**

1.  **Operational Readiness:** Focus investment on the operational integration of new LRT lines and major roads, including advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to maximize efficiency.
2.  **LID Standardization:** Fully integrate LID principles into the Neighbourhood Renewal Program to ensure climate resilience extends to mature communities.
3.  **Social Equity Metrics:** Prioritize community infrastructure projects (e.g., Lewis Farms, supportive housing) in underserved areas to ensure equitable distribution of public services.
