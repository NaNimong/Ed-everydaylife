            <p>A notable urban revitalization project is the <strong>O-day'min Park</strong>, which opened in November 2025. This new downtown park, equivalent in size to 4.5 NFL football fields, was transformed from underutilized parking lots into a community space, serving as a catalyst for private investment and downtown revitalization.</p>

            <h3>Building Community Hubs: Social Infrastructure for Wellness</h3>
            <p>To meet the growing need for connection and belonging, the City is investing in new, inclusive recreational facilities designed to serve as community hubs. The <strong>Coronation Park Sports and Recreation Centre</strong> ($153 million) was completed in November 2025 and is set to open in early 2026. This facility features a 250-meter Category A indoor cycling track (velodrome), aiming to host world-class cycling and triathlon events. In the west end, the <strong>Lewis Farms Facility and Park</strong> ($309 million) is under construction, with a target completion of 2028. It will include a 50-meter pool, two ice rinks, a fitness center, and an Edmonton Public Library branch, serving approximately 75,000 area residents.</p>

            <h3>Taking Care of What We Have: Rehabilitation and Modernization</h3>
            <p>A critical component of the city's strategy is the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to ensure public safety, address aging assets, and modernize facilities to current standards.</p>
